== Binary compatibility

=== Checking binary compatibility

* Important for build authors (build scripts)
* **and** for plugin authors

* Use the `japicmp-gradle-plugin`
* Checked on every commit
* Changes **must** be accepted and documented

=== Fixing binary compatibility

* Sometimes we _have to_ remove internal APIs
* But some plugins use them/reference them
* Often accidental leakage in public APIs (e.g `AbstractTask`)
* Solution: runtime decoration of classes
** Decorates classes with the missing methods
** Advantage: source-compatible and binary-compatible

=== Runtime decoration use-cases

* Conversion of plugins from Groovy to Java
* Removal of internal/deprecated types
