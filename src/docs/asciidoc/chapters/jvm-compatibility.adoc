== Java version

=== Gradle

* Gradle is a JVM tool
* Used to build JVM apps (but not only)
* To run Gradle
** Java 8 up to Java 11
** 12 under test
** Nice error message if trying to run on 6/7

=== Component being built

* Same version as Gradle (embedded)
* Any version of Java (forking)

=== Consequences

* We only start using Java 8 features in code
* Some modules still require Java 6 bytecode
** Entry point (CLI)
** Workers (because of communication)
* Hard to untangle!

=== How do we test?

* Different CI pipelines
** full test suite on Java 11 (soon 12)
** reduced test suites on Java 7 to 11
** Different vendors (OpenJDK, IBM JDK)

=== Complicating factors

* Gradle analyzes JARs
* Requires ASM
** ASM only supports official releases
** People want to try early JDK releases...
