== Continous integration

=== On CI

* We use TeamCity
* Each commit triggers ~500 builds
* Lots of build outputs reused thanks to the build cache
** Dramatically reduces feedback loop
** Available for Apache Maven too!

=== Staged builds

* Sanity check
** Compile
** Checkstyle, Spotbugs, CodeNarc, ...
** Binary compatibility
*  Branch build (x2)
** Integration tests
** Linux and Windows
** Performance tests
** Gradleception


=== Staged builds

* Merge accept
** Cross-version testing
** More TAPI tests
** Smoke tests
* Daily build
** Slow performance tests
** Internal variants test (slower code paths)
