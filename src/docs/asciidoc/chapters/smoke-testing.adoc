== Smoke testing

=== Testing well known plugins

* Test coverage is never enough
* Despite our efforts, popular plugins use internal APIs
* Smoke tests to discover breaking changes
** Spring Dependency Management, Android, Shadow plugins
** Netflix Nebula plugins (lint, recommender, ...)
** Asciidoctor, Spotbugs, Docker plugins etc...

=== Improvement process

* If a user reports a regression
* and that it's a popular plugin
* then add a smoke test for the plugin

Then **consider a plugin API** for missing pieces
