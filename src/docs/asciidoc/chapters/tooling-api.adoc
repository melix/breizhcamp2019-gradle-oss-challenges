== The Tooling API

=== The Tooling API

* Allows "embedding" Gradle
* Mostly for IDEs
* Must support _older_ releases (backwards compatibility)
* Must support _newer_ releases (forward compatibility)

=== How it works

* Communication protocol based on serialization
** Daemon is required
** Models passed through build invocations
* Backwards compatibility
** Handled similarly to the regular process
* Forward compatiblity
** Inteface-based protocol
** Default implementation when missing methods

=== Cross-version testing
