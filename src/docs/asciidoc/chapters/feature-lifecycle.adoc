== Feature lifecycle

=== Incubating APIs

* When a feature is introduced, _always_ `@Incubating`
* Doesn't mean _beta_, means _may_ change or go away
* Allows us to remove without _deprecating_
* We haven't been good at de-incubating

=== Typical deprecation handling

* Deprecate in version `MAJOR`
* Warn users about deprecations
* Remove in `MAJOR+1`

=== Exceptions to the rule

* If `MAJOR+1` is close enough, deprecate for removal in `MAJOR+2`
* "soft deprecation" for very widely used features
** e.g: `compile` and `runtime` configurations
** very hard to remove!

=== Preparing users for changes

* Build scans report deprecations
